# CTP_Wine_Quality
Notebook and lesson outline for CTP interview

Lesson Outline:

Students come in to the lesson with an understanding of:
* Pandas dataframes and how to load data into a dataframe
* Exploratory data analysis in python
* Basic understanding of the machine learning process, specifically why we train test split and how to do it in sklearn

Lecture: 
The lecture will start with some basic motivation for linear regression, including the idea that we're trying to find the line of best fit, how we generalize from a single feature to multiple features, maybe a brief description of ordinary least squares, and an overview of methods for evaluating or linear regression model. (Lesson plan to be fleshed out later)

Lab:
Students will follow these steps, with example code in the jupyter notebook:
Step 1: Load the data into a dataframe.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis -- do we need to do any data cleaning before building our model?
Step 3: Train-test split
Step 4: Train a basic linear regression model.
Step 5: Evaluate the base model using r-squared and root mean squared error.
Step 6: Iterate on the base model to see if we can improve our chosen metrics. Experiment with taking out different features. Use standard scaling to scale the features. Try variations on linear regression such as ridge regression or lasso regression.
